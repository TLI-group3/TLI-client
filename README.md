# TLI-client

The TLI-client is the frontend of our program. 

React Javascript will be used to build the webpage and input UIs. When an account holder's name is typed into the input UI, the frontend will send a request to our database to get that account holder's list of recommended cars. Then, the recommended cars will be displaced on the webpage along with the his/her best available loan product.
